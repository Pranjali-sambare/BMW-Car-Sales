Hey connections!!
Planning for new Car And want to dive deeper into BMW's sales data? 

Check out my interactive dashboard.
I crafted this interactive Power BI dashboard to delve into BMW's sales trends, top-selling models, and regional performance. By leveraging time series analysis, I've developed actionable insights to support strategic decision-making. 


Key insights include:

Dashboard 1
Global Sales: The dashboard shows an overall increase in global sales of BMW, with a 23.1% growth rate. 
Top-Selling Models: The "Top Selling Model" chart identifies the BMW X5 as the best-selling model, followed by the BMW X6 and BMW Z4. 
Sales by Country: The "Sales by Country" chart reveals that the Collectivity of Saint Martin has the highest sales volume, followed by Qatar and the Philippines. 
Sales by Channel: The "Qty Sold by Channel" chart indicates that dealers have the highest sales volume compared to wholesalers. 
Sales by Year: The "Qty Sold by Year" chart shows a steady increase in sales volume from 2020 to 2022.

Dashboard 2
Model: The dashboard focuses on the BMW Z4 model, displaying its image prominently. 
Average Price: The average price of the BMW Z4 is displayed as 78.12K (currency is not specified). 
Quantity Sold by Year: A table shows the quantity of BMW Z4s sold in each year from 2020 to 2023. The total quantity sold is 150,372.


This project showcased my ability to transform data into compelling visualizations and actionable insights. Let's discuss how these insights can drive business success.
